## What is Apptainer?

Apptainer is an open source container platform designed to be simple, fast,
and secure. Many container platforms are available, but Apptainer is designed
for ease-of-use on shared systems and in high performance computing (HPC)
environments. It features:

- An immutable single-file container image format, supporting cryptographic
  signatures and encryption.
- Integration over isolation by default. Easily make use of GPUs, high speed
  networks, parallel filesystems on a cluster or server.
- Mobility of compute. The single file SIF container format is easy to transport
  and share.
- A simple, effective security model. You are the same user inside a container
  as outside, and cannot gain additional privilege on the host system by
  default.

Apptainer is open source software, distributed under the [BSD License](LICENSE.md).

## Citing Apptainer

Apptainer can be cited using its former name Singularity.

The Singularity software may be cited using our Zenodo DOI `10.5281/zenodo.1310023`:

> <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1310023>

This is an 'all versions' DOI for referencing Singularity in a manner that is
not version-specific. You may wish to reference the particular version of
Singularity used in your work. Zenodo creates a unique DOI for each release,
and these can be found in the 'Versions' sidebar on the [Zenodo record page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1310023).

Please also consider citing the original publication describing Singularity:
