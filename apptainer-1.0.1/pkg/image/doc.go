Package image provides underlying data types for Apptainer image
formats. Additionally, all image types will satisfy the ImageFormat{}
interface. This interface will expose all things necessary to use
an Apptainer image, whether through OCI or directly.

    Root() *spec.Root - Root() returns the OCI compliant root of the
                        Image. This function may perform some action,
                        such as extracting the filesystem to a dir.
